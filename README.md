# CS2 Retakes Allocator

Very early version, should be working as described below.

## Retakes

This plugin is made to run alongside B3none's retakes implementation: https://github.com/b3none/cs2-retakes

## Installation

- Ensure you have https://github.com/b3none/cs2-retakes installed already
- Update the `RetakesPlugin` config to have `EnableFallbackAllocation` disabled
- Download a release from https://github.com/yonilerner/cs2-retakes-allocator/releases
- Extract the zip archive and upload the `RetakesAllocator` plugin to your CounterStrikeSharp plugins folder on your
  server
    - [ADVANCED] If you want to reduce the upload size, you can delete all runtimes in the `RetakesAllocator` folder
      except the one needed for your particular server

## Usage

### Round Types

This plugin implements 3 different round types:

- Pistol
    - Weapons: Only pistols
    - Armor: Kevlar and no helmet
    - Util: Flash or smoke, except one CT that gets a defuse kit
- HalfBuy (shotguns and SMGs)
    - Weapons: Shotguns and SMGs
    - Armor: Kevlar and helmet
    - Util: One nade + 50% chance of a 2nd nade. Every CT has a defuse kit
- FullBuy (Rifles, snipers, machine guns)
    - Weapons: Rifles, snipers, machine guns
    - Armor: Kevlar and helmet
    - Util: One nade + 50% chance of a 2nd nade. Every CT has a defuse kit

### Configuration

- `RoundTypePercentages`: The frequency of each type of round. The values must add up to `100`.
- `UsableWeapons`: The weapons that can be allocated. Any weapon removed from this list cannot be used.
- `AllowedWeaponSelectionTypes`: The types of weapon allocation that are allowed.
    - Choices:
        - `PlayerChoice` - Allow players to choose their preferences for the round type
        - `Random` - Everyone gets a random weapon for the round type
        - `Default` - Everyone gets a default weapon for the round type. The defaults are:
            - T Pistol: Glock
            - CT Pistol: USPS
            - T HalfBuy: Mac10
            - CT HalfBuy: MP9
            - T Rifle: AK47
            - CT Rifle: M4A4
    - These will be tried in order of `PlayerChoice`, `Random`, and `Default`. If a player preference is not available,
      or this type is removed from the config, a random weapon will be tried. If random weapons are removed from the
      config, a default weapon will be tried. If default weapons are removed from the config, no weapons will be
      allocated.
- `MigrateOnStartup`: Whether or not to migrate the database on startup. This defaults to yes for now, but production
  servers may want to change this to false so they can control when database migrations are applied.

### Commands

You can use the following commands to select specific weapon preferences per-user:

- `!gun <weapon> [T|CT]` - Set a preference the chosen weapon for the team you are currently on, or T/CT if provided
    - For example, if you are currently a terrorist and you do `!gun galil`, your preference for rifle rounds will be
      Galil
- `!removegun <weapon> [T|CT]` - Remove a preference for the chosen weapon for the team you are currently on, or T/CT if
  provided
    - For example, if you previously did `!gun galil` while a terrorist, and you do `!removegun galil` while a
      terrorist, you will no longer prefer the galil, and will instead get a random weapon
- `!nextround <P|H|F>` - For admins only. Force the next round to be the selected type.
- `!reload_allocator_config` - For admins only. Reload the JSON config in-place.

# Building

- Download a release (I used 142) from https://github.com/roflmuffin/CounterStrikeSharp/releases/ and copy the
  extracted `addon` folder to this project's `CounterStrikeSharp` folder
- [Optional] To automatically copy the built DLL to your running server location, set the build variable `CopyPath` to
  the folder where the mod should be copied to
    - *This only works on Windows*

Notes:

- Run the dedicated server
  with `start cs2.exe -dedicated -insecure +game_type 0 +game_mode 0 +map de_dust2 +servercfgfile server.cfg`
